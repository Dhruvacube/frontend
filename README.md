This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses the Tailwind CSS Framework.

## Getting Started

NOTE: In order to run it you need to have a active internet connection (since some fonts and api fetching would happen) and you need to have [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git instalation page") installed and configured.

First clone the repo (run these in a bash terminal) and get inside that folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvacube/frontend-gems-ieee.git
```

Then get inside the cloned repo

```bash
cd frontend-gems-ieee
```

Then install the Node packages from npm

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
